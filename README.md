# Welcome to the busylittlemobileapp ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ro. I like making web (and now app) stuff go "bing bing".

This is a React Native project, built (largely on) [Expo](https://expo.dev).
It is the mobile, user-facing application of [BusyLittlePlatform](https://busylittleplatform.vercel.app), which is built on NextJS and (the absolutely fucking AWESOME Supabase). This is accessible via the "Platform" link on the [BLP dev site](https://blpwebsite-2-0.vercel.app/platform)

## Installation

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo
